## The problem

Executing an inputted string, as JS code can be **Extremely** risky. These risks can be reduced, when using `new Function` syntax; however, this can also be limiting, as it would only give you access to the global scope.

## This solution âœ¨

`js-exec` will sandbox the JavaScript code (passed as a string). It will only give it access to the objects that are given to the sandbox. This way, you will have full control of what the code can or cannot access.

## Features

- **No Dependencies** - no dependencies
- **TypeScript** - Everything is TypeScript based
- **Lint** - Preconfigured _ESlint_ with _Airbnb_ config
- **Interceptors** - pass in interceptors to the sandbox, to manipulate the source, before being executed

## Execute TypeScript

We are adding a TypeScript [interceptors](#interceptors), very soon. Please stay tuned for exciting news.

## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) which should be installed as one of your project's `dependencies`:

```bash
npm i --save js-exec
```

## Usage

### Basic

- [Install `js-exec`](#installation)
- Import `exec` from the package
- Pass the source to `exec`.
- Use the sandbox returned to pass dependencies to the code.

```ts
import { exec } from "js-exec";

const source = `console.log("Hello from js-exec ðŸ‘‹");`;

const sandbox = exec(source);

sandbox();
// Error: Cannot read property 'log' of undefined

sandbox({ console });
// Hello from js-exec ðŸ‘‹
```

### Callbacks

The `exec`function will accept a second parameterâ€”i.e. `options`â€”for additional customizations.

You can pass in `onSuccess` and `onError` callbacks to the `options` object:

```ts
import { exec } from "js-exec";

const source = `console.log("Hello from js-exec ðŸ‘‹");`;

const sandbox = exec(source, {
  onSuccess: () => console.log("Taadaa ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰"),
  onError: (e: Error) => console.log("Something occurred ðŸ¥º\n", e),
});

sandbox({});
// Something occurred ðŸ¥º
// TypeError: Cannot read property 'log' of undefined

sandbox({ console });
// Hello from js-exec ðŸ‘‹
// Taadaa ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
```

### Interceptors

Interceptors will help you run functions on the code, before it gets executed.

Each Interceptor receives a `source: string` and returns a transformed `source: string`.

```ts
import { exec, Source } from "js-exec";

const source = `console.log("There are some f***s here!");`;

//Removes bad words inside the source
const removeBadWords = (source: Source): Source => {
  let cleanSource = source;
  const badWordsArray = ["f***"];
  const textToReplace = "ðŸš«BAD WORDðŸš«";
  badWordsArray.forEach(
    (word) => (cleanSource = cleanSource.replace(word, textToReplace))
  );
  return cleanSource;
};

//Interceptors are run sequentially
const interceptors = [removeBadWords];

//interceptors are passed into the options object
const runCode = exec(source, { interceptors });
runCode({ console });
// There are some ðŸš«BAD WORDðŸš«s here!
```
### Global Values

You can also make values available, on all executions of the sandbox; If, you wish to re-use them.



```ts
const pi = 3.141592;

const globalValues = { pi }

//pi will be available on every execution of runCode
const runCode = exec(source, { globalValues });
```

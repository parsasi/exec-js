## The problem

Executing an inputted string, as JS code can be **Extremely** risky. These risks can be reduced, when using `new Function` syntax; however, this can also be limiting, as it would only give you access to the global scope.

## This solution âœ¨

`js-exec` will sandbox the JavaScript code (passed as a string). It will only give it access to the objects that are given to the sandbox. This way, you will have full control of what the code can or cannot access.
